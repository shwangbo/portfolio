> #### Two Historical Research Papers that Stemmed from School Subjects
> - [May 18 Democratic](https://shwangbo.github.io/portfolio/assets/research/Sophia Hwangbo_May 18 Democratic.pdf)   
>   - In May 1980, students in the Southwest city of Gwanju led a protest against the martial law placed over the entire nation by the dictatorship in Korea.On May 18, protesters clashed with military forces sent to stop the protests. For ten days, the national military brutally suppressed the people indiscriminately, massacring many children and students. This event is widely acknowledged in Korea as an important protest and start of democracy in Korea

> - [Canadian Residential Schools](https://shwangbo.github.io/portfolio/assets/research/Sophia Hwangbo_Canadian Residential Schools_SECOND ESSAY.pdf)   
>   - Canadian Residential Schools were a systematic series of boarding schools where indigenous children were forced to enroll and were stripped of their culture and identity in these schools as an effort to assimilate them into Canadian society. Many children died as a result of malnutrition, abuse and disease from poor living spaces. These deaths were often improperly dealt with, leaving missing children when the schools closed down.
